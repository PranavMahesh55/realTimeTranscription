Alright so for this just run the realTimeTranscription.py file and before you do that change up the whisperModel from 'small.en' to 'large-v3', 
cause my internet is horrible here and it wont downlaod properly

also change device to cuda, if you want it to process and run during runtime faster, and obv set up cuda, rest should be same, and let me know how it performs
